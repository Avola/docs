#### Creating your first decision table
Structuring your decisions can seem very intimidating, but it's actually quite easy. You can create your first decision using the three-step builder seen below. 
![Create your first decision](/images/using-avola-free/create-your-first-decision.png)

In the first step, you'll have to choose a name for your decision and the verb that fits your needs (calculate, determine or define). Then indicate what type of data your decision will result in: a whole number value, a text value or a yes/no value. Lastly, determine on which conditions your result is based. After filling in the appropriate information, click 'create'.

*For example*<br>
*I want to determine the level of happiness. So I fill in: determine happiness, which is a text value. My level of happiness is influenced by the temperature in degrees Celsius (number value), and the amount of hours I slept during the previous night (number value). Those I add as conditions and I click create.*

#### Adding your logic to the created decision table
![Add your logic](/images/using-avola-free/add-your-logic.png)
Now, you can see the structure of your first decision table. On the right, I have the decision I want to make called 'happiness'. The two columns to the left of 'happiness' show the conditions my result is based upon. This is where you can start **adding your logic and the result they will lead to by clicking 'add row'**. Every row will make up 1 rule. Make sure to add every possible answer per condition and the result they will lead to!

*Example*<br>
*If the temperature is above 25°C I am very happy, no matter how many hours I’ve slept.*<br>
*If the temperature is between 20 and 25 degrees and I have slept 7 or more hours, I am happy.*<br>
*If the temperature is between 20 and 25 degrees and I have slept less than 7 hours, I feel neutral.*<br>
*If the temperature is below 20 degrees and I have slept 7 or more hours, I feel neutral.*<br>
*If the temperature is below 20 degrees and I have slept less than 7 hours, I feel unhappy.*<br>

All the example rules mentioned are structured in the table above. Don't forget to save your changes! Afterwards, you can click the options button on the right to **see the decision model** of your table.
